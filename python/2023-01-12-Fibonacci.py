''' Exercise from https://code.golf/fibonacci#python The idea is to try to solve the problem in the least amount of characters
The Fibonacci numbers are a numerical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13â€¦

Print the first 31 Fibonacci numbers from F0 = 0 to F30 = 832040 (inclusive), each on a separate line.
